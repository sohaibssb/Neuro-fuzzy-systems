# Neuro-fuzzy-systems
Clustering, Classification & Deep Learning Labs

Programmed by Sohaibssb for Neuro-fuzzy-systems Course at Bauman University. 2023.

Lab#1: Clustering, feature space dimensionality reduction
k-means method and DBSCAN method
Elbow method
Using PCA, MDS methods 
Using t-SNE, UMAP 

Lab#2: Classification, assessment of classification accuracy
For the data set.

Lab#3: Word processing
vectorize texts using two methods:
- frequency or tf*idf;
- static or contextualized vector models.
The resulting text vectors must either be clustered. On the resulting clusters, it is necessary to train the clustering method and check the accuracy of its work.
It is necessary to compare the accuracy of the method with and without the use of morphological analysis.

Lab#4: Dense Neural Networks
Train the perceptron on one of the sets used above data and compare the accuracy of its work with previously used methods.
